# Satellite Analysis Project
This project analyzes satellite lifetimes and orbital characteristics using the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) Satellite Database. The dataset provides information on satellite metadata, operators, orbital parameters, launch details, and expected lifetimes. After cleaning and standardizing the data, I conducted an exploratory analysis to examine patterns in launch activity, operational status, and orbital clustering across LEO, MEO, and GEO. A two-sample t-test confirmed that active satellites have significantly longer design lifetimes than expired ones, reflecting improvements in design and mission planning. Visualizations, including time-series plots, stacked bars, scatterplots, and 3D orbital distributions, highlight both the rapid growth of satellite activity and the emerging risks of orbital congestion. The findings underscore the need for longer-lifetime designs, better LEO congestion management, and stronger global deorbit and debris mitigation policies. While the UCS database provides valuable insights, limitations include estimated rather than observed lifetimes, lag in updates, and missing values for some technical fields. Future work could extend this analysis with debris population datasets, predictive modeling, and scenario forecasts of the orbital risk environment through 2035.
